How to eat better ?
===================


After looking some articles like `this <https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/03/challenges-sustainable-food-2017-organic-farming>`_ or this `one <http://thespiritscience.net/2015/10/18/hershey-nestle-and-mars-use-child-slaves-to-make-your-chocolate/>`_, I'm forced to admit that there's a big problem.

What about massive meat production factories ?
----------------------------------------------

I wont suggest you stoping eating meat. I actually like meat.
The point is that these days, most of us are eating meat everyday. That is the problem.
Each Human eats around 180g of meat each day and that number is growing.

And obviously, as our needs in meat (that are actually already enormous) are growing, so is animal agriculture.


So, do we have alternatives ?
-----------------------------

Actually, there are so many alternatives like Falafel, seitan, tempeh, tofu, amarante, split peas, coral lentils soya proteins… 
And more…

But the point is not about meat. It's about fair food.

You can replace meat by tofu, for example, that is actually made of soya.

   Amazonia is actually deforested in order to grow gigantic amounts of soya (source: `greenpeace.fr <https://www.greenpeace.fr/amazonie-arret-de-la-deforestation-liee-aux-plantations-de-soja/>`_)

L’école de santé publique de Harvard recommande de limiter notre consommation de viande à 90g par jour (nous en consommons actuellement 180g/j)
et de limiter la consommation de laitages à deux portions par jours. Nous en consommons entre 2,5 et 3 portions dans les pays occidentaux.


What could I do to make things better ?
---------------------------------------

A `list <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegetarians>`_ of famous vegetarians.

Actually, more than 200 000 people are dying every year in France because of poor eating habits, and most of the time, it's about eating meat.

To not eating (or eat less) meat could contribute to a healthier life for everybody, including animals.

By the way, it's important to understand that meat, or fish, or eggs of even milk is not needed for our health.
So we can chose to not eat this.
