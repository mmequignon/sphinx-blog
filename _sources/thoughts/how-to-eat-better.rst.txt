How to eat better ?
===================

After looking some articles like `this <https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/03/challenges-sustainable-food-2017-organic-farming>`_ or this `one <http://thespiritscience.net/2015/10/18/hershey-nestle-and-mars-use-child-slaves-to-make-your-chocolate/>`_, I'm forced to admit that there's a big problem.

What about massive meat production factories ?
----------------------------------------------

 - 83% of broilers are raised indoor.
 - 68% of chikens and 99% of rabbits are caged.
 - 20% of raised pigs dies before they are killed.

   Vegan ? What is it ? Is that something I can eat? (source: `tumblr.com - carlvegandude <http://carlvegandude.tumblr.com/post/131938748612>`_)

I wont suggest you quitting eating meat. Actually, I do like meat myself.
The point is that these days, more or less everyone are eating meat everyday, and that should be a concern.
Each Human eats around 180g of meat each day and that number is growing.

And obviously, as our needs in meat (that are actually already enormous) are growing, so is animal agriculture.

Breeding is the cause of more than 14,5% greenhouse gas emission according to this `link <http://leclimatchange.fr/attenuations-des-changements/>`_.

Animals raised for their meat consumes far more water than any vegetable for the same quantity of food.

   Hi folks ! (source: `LeMonde <http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2012/07/28/hollande-defend-le-foie-gras-francais-face-aux-lobbys-anglosaxons_1739762_823448.html>`_)

There are also some ethical reasons, to stop eating raised animals. Their living conditions are actually horrible.

We can I will never protest, about carrots abuse !

So, do we have alternatives ?
-----------------------------

Actually, there are so many alternatives like Falafel, seitan, tempeh, tofu, amarante, split peas, coral lentils, soya…
And more…

But the point is not about meat. It's about fair food.

For example, you can replace meat by tofu, that is actually made of soya.
But the fact is that Amazonia is deforested in order to grow gigantic amounts of soya.
Not fair…

Maybe I could eat chocolate bars ?
No, because in West Africa, that is slave childs that are actually making our chocolate bars.
Not fair…

What could I do to make things better ?
---------------------------------------

First, we could all eat less meat. Harvard school of public health recommends to eat around 90g of meat per day, instead of the average 180g consumed today.
They also recommend to restrict the consumtion of dairy products. Most of us are eating an average of 2.5 servings per day in Western countries.

We could also favor local products. Actually, to goal is not to make actual farmers produce more, but to have more farmers, so we could eat better products.

Also, In france, a child can't work before 16 years old. In boycotting Nestlé, Mars and Hershey we will indirectly protect childs of East Africa that do not have laws to protect them.

Actually, more than 200 000 people are dying every year in France because of poor eating habits, and most of the time, it's about eating meat.

To not eating (or eat less) meat could contribute to a healthier life for everybody, including animals.

By the way, it's important to understand that meat, or fish, or eggs of even milk is not needed for our health.
So we can chose to not eat these products, or to reduce our consumption.
