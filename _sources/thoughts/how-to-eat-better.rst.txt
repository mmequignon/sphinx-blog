How to eat better ?
===================

Some facts
++++++++++

Animal welfare
--------------

Raised animales are living in unacceptable conditions.
For example :

 - 83% of broilers are raised indoor;
 - 68% of chikens and 99% of rabbits are caged;
 - 20% of raised pigs dies before they are killed.

   Vegan ? What is it ? Is that something I can eat? (source: `tumblr.com - carlvegandude <http://carlvegandude.tumblr.com/post/131938748612>`_)

In the dairy industry, males are useless.
However, females must have calves to give milk.
Males are then killed from birth, in order to not feed them.

In the foie-gras industry, ducks are spoiled all their lives.
In some farms, they are attached, with the abdomen wide opened in order to check the size of their liver.
Once it's big enough, ducks are then killed.

   Breeding is the cause of more than 16% greenhouse gas emission according to the :ref:`IPCC Fifth Assessment Report <ipcc>`.

Animals raised for their meat consumes far more water than any vegetable for the same quantity of food.

We could produce enormous quantities of vegetables. I will never protest about carrots abuse !

Ethical eating
--------------

Actually, there are so many alternatives like chickpea, seitan, tempeh, tofu, amarante, split peas, coral lentils, soya, quinoa…
And more…

But the point is not about meat. It's about fair food.

For example, you can replace meat by tofu, that is actually made of soya and is a good source of protein.
But the fact is that Amazonia is deforested in order to grow gigantic amounts of soya.
Not fair…

Some brands of chocolate-based produits like Mars of Nestlé use slave-children in West-Africa to harvest cocoa.
Not fair…

Jean-Baptiste Malet wrote a book named «`L'empire de l'or rouge <http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2017/06/12/la-tomate-fruit-pourri-de-l-agro-mafia_1576305>`_» which talks about tomatoes.
Most of processed tomatoes we eat are cultivated in China and harvested by slave children.
In the south of Italy, a slave association named «caporalato» hire illegal immigrants to cultivate an harvest tomatoes.
And that's what we are actually eating, in eating pizzas, ketchup, etc…
Not fair…

To not eating (or eat less) meat could contribute to a healthier life for everybody, including animals.

What should we do to make things better ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, we could all eat less meat.
Harvard school of public health recommends to eat around 90g of meat per day, instead of the average 180g consumed today.
They also recommend to restrict the consumtion of dairy products. Most of us are eating an average of 2.5 servings per day in Western countries.

We could also favor local products.
Actually, to goal is not to make actual farmers produce more, but to have more farmers, so we could eat better products.
Everybody should be able to say where their food come from.
Well, it's also good from an economic point of view.

Also, In france, a child can't work before 16 years old.
In boycotting several industry-made food, we will protect children of other countries that do not have laws to protect them.

By the way, it's important to understand that meat, fish, eggs or even milk is not needed for our health.
So we can chose to not eat these products, or to reduce our consumption.
