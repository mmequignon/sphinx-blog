lxc-up / down
=============

My scripts for starting / stopping containers.

usage ::

    lxc-up `container-name`
    lxc-down `container-name`

dependancies :

    * softs : sshfs, tmux
    * ssh properly configured, with .ssh/config file and key authentication.

lxc up
------

    * Starts the container container-name.
    * Mounts the remote homedir on ~/sshfs/containername with sshfs.
    * Creates a tmux session, named container-name.
    * Creates a first window in the tmux session named "CODE".
    * Creates a second one, named "SERVER" logged into the container through SSH.
    * Creates a third one, named "TUN", and open a SSH tunnel. Here, the tunel targets the postgres default bind port. You can change this, depending of your need, as the localhost port.

.. literalinclude:: lxc-up
   :language: bash

lxc-down
--------

    * Kills the tmux session.
    * Unmount the sshfs mountpoint.
    * Stops the container.

.. literalinclude:: lxc-down
   :language: bash
