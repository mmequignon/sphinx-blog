pg-cli
======

Just a wrapper of the pgcli postgres client.

Usage::

    pg-cli <container-name> <db-name>

Requirements :

    * pgcli_
    * a /tmp/pg_table file filled by the lxc-up_ script.
    * SSH properly configured.

It allows me to connect on a remote database, available on localhost through a SSH tunnel.

    It uses the /tmp/pg_table created by the lxc-up script to get the port to connect on.
    It gets the username to connect with in your ~/.ssh/config file.
