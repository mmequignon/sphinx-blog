About me
++++++++

Hi, my name is `Matthieu <https://github.com/mmequignon>`_. I'm following sandwich courses at `ULCO <http://www.univ-littoral.fr/>`_ (Université du Littoral, Côte d'Opale) in Calais and working at `Osiell <https://github.com/osiell>`_ in Rennes.

I'm a Python fanboy, and a fervent defender of Free Software.

I also like to play guitar.

I've heard, once "The linux way of solving problems" that's exactly what I like.
