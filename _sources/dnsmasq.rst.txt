LXC and Dnsmasq
===============

As I'm working in a lxc environment, I create many containers. The problem is that I have to configure network in all of them.
My co-worker (actually using ubuntu) told me that on his computer, all his containers get automatically their network config.

Well I'm a Debian fanboy, I'll do it by myself.
I'm considering, here, that the host's network is already configured, and that you have enabled net ipv4 forwarding in /etc/sysctl.conf.

First, you will have to install dnsmasq::

    sudo apt install dnsmasq

You'll also need to execute a command when <INTERFACE> is up, so you'll need to make a script (one per physical interface) like this one::

    #!/bin/bash
    [ "$IFACE" = <INTERFACE> ] || exit 0
    iptables -t nat -F
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -o <INTERFACE> -j MASQUERADE

This script, executes two iptables instructions each time <INTERFACE> is up.
The first one just flushes the nat table, the second one, just nat trafic to destination of your virtual network on <INTERFACE>.

Here, you can now edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf::

    #Virtual interface that will be created
    interface=br0                                                                                                                                                  
    
    #those lines are for the dhcp configuration, network, netmask and ip addresses range
    domain=lxc,10.0.0.0/8
    dhcp-range = 10.0.0.100,10.0.0.200,1h
    
    #This line is here to define the domain
    local=/lxc/
    
    log-dhcp
    log-queries


Then, in /etc/lxc/default::

    lxc.network.type =veth                                                                                                                                        
    lxc.network.link = br0 

At this point, everything works. More or lessâ€¦
Maybe you've tried to start a container and watched the logs. Dnsmasq received dhcp discover requests from the container, returned the offer, and nothing after.
The problem is that dnsmasq doesn't send packets with a checksum, and so, dhcp client refuses them.
So, you will have to execute this command at every host startup::

    iptables -A POSTROUTING -t mangle -p udp --dport bootpc -j CHECKSUM --checksum-fill

At this point, your container get it's network configuration at startup.

Dnsmasq is not only a DHCP server, it's also a DNS server. So we can use the dhcp cache to get containers hostnames.

Just add this line in you /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf::

    prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

As you can see, when you request for a network configuration to your dhcp, the dhcp client will prepend the returned dns by the dnsmasq address.

You can now make things like::

    lxc-create test; lxc-start test; ping test.lxc

Enjoy !
